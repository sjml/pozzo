running list of tests that still need to be written as I think of them, awaiting the day I feel like it

    delete individual image
        - no longer in album
        - upload image, should go at end rather than in the gap
    delete album + images
        - images are gone from server
    deleting groups
    once exif import has been revised, check stored column data for images and make sure it matches expectations

found by code coverage:
    - need images in corpus that:
        - have different orientations
    - login validation should check that the user in the token exists
    - try logging in as user that doesn't exist: should hit null return in GetUser
    - removing cover photo from album
        - deleting or moving photos from album resets coverphoto if needed
    - copy photos to album by slug
    - edit non-existent album
    - reorder non-existent album
