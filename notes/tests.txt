Make a simple little Python test script that runs requests against the backend.
Have it test looking for every possible return code from the endpoints.

✅ -- check written and currently passing

backend functionality tests
    ✅ setup site (create user)
    ✅ cannot setup site again
    ✅ can't log in without credentials
    ✅ can't log in with wrong credentials
    ✅ can log in with right credentials
    ✅ login check serves new usable token
    ✅ can't upload without credentials
    ✅ can upload with credentials
    ✅ cannot upload incorrect file type
    ✅ cannot upload incorrect image type
    ✅ upload 10 pictures, verify hashes
    ✅ verify that all declared sizes exist for all images
    ✅ download original image and confirm it has same hash as upload
    ✅ all uploads should be in unsorted
    ✅ create new album
    ✅ move 5 pictures to that album
    ✅ create another new album (set to private)
    ✅ credentialed user can see album
    ✅ non-credentialed cannot
    ✅ non-credentialed cannot edit album metadata
    ✅ credentialed can edit album metadata
    ✅ reorder images in album
    ✅ reorder album list
    ✅ non-credentialed cannot delete album
    ✅ credentialed can delete album
    delete individual image
        - no longer in album
        - upload image, should go at end rather than in the gap
    delete album + images
        - images are gone from server
    once exif import has been revised, check stored column data for images and make sure it matches expectations

found by code coverage:
    - need images in corpus that:
        - have different orientations
    - login validation should check that the user in the token exists
    - try logging in as user that doesn't exist: should hit null return in GetUser
    - removing cover photo from album
        - deleting or moving photos from album resets coverphoto if needed
    - copy photos to album by slug
    - edit non-existent album
    - reorder non-existent album

perf/size
    don't let import time of realistic-sized album rise above X
    don't let lighthouse score of realistic-sized album drop below 90
    don't let javascript bundle size rise above X
