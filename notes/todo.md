1. Frontend basic looks
   - make basic album view
2. New album frontend hookup
   - login flow
3. Create new album during sort
4. Nice transitions between albums
5. Individual picture view
   - exif w/map embed
6. Splash page

## future
* special handling for unsorted album? (automatically removing from it)
* testing setup
* robustify router:
    - handlers should be able to specify which methods they take
* sweep through API responses and make sure there's some consistency
    - "error" vs "message", response codes, JSON schema, etc.
